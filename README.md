## Dataset

The Ford Gobike dataset includes information about 183412 rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for February 2019. The dataset contains information about each ride distance, location and duration (start_time, start_station, end_time, end_station) as well as information about the user (gender, age, type of user).

## Summary of Findings

In conclusion. the trips in the sanfransisco bay area for february 2019 show that the bike share users ride more during the weekdays than the weekends. This may be as a result of users commuting to and from their workplaces. This hypothesis was backed up by the barchart showing the peak ride start times at 8am and 5pm which are typical resumption and closing time.

Next, we discovered that during the weekends, the customers take more rides than the subscribers. We also noticed that the most popular ride period was during the afternoons unlike during weekdays when rides were mostly in the mornings.

We found out that the age of users and duration of rides had no correlation however, the customers took longer rides on average than the subscribers.

## Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation, I focused on describing the users and showing the behaviour of the different groups of users (based on their age, gender, type of user), and left out most of the intermediate analysis and visuals.

I started out by showing the popular ride days and how the ride frequency changed during the weekends. Next, I showed the distribution of users based on gender, age and user type. Finally, I showed the behaviour of the two user types (the days they took more rides and their average durations). I also showed how gender and age did not necessarily affect the frequency and duration of rides.

Throughout the analysis and presentation, I ensured I used different palettes for each categorical variable to clearly show their difference.
